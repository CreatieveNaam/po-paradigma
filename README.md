# Introduction

This repository contains code and process details for my school assignment 'PO-paradigma'. My assignment is to learn a new programming language that interests me and differs from the programming language we are used to at school: Java.

This assignments purpose is to learn a new programming language by myself and to spread the knowledge I got from this assignment to fellow students. 

The new programming language I want to learn is assembly for the x86-64 instruction set. I chose assembly because I think it's important that software developers know how software works near the hardware level. Also, I have an interest in reverse-engineering but I never found an opportunity to learn assembly, so this is the ideal time to learn assembly.

The bulk of my information will come from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQAKkuLL31g&list=PLetF-YjXm-sCH6FrTz4AQhfH6INDQvQSn) Youtube guide. My plan is to watch every video so I can provide a summary of the video and to implement my own version of code that was treated during the video.

During this assignment I will use the following tools:
- Debian 10.3 as operation system.
- NASM as assembler
- ld from the binutils package as linker
- Currently nano as 'IDE' but I will probably change this..
